Ask a question about `slackr`!

If you're having trouble, see the README, the vignettes, and the other issues that have already been posted before posting a duplicate issue. 

If your question hasn't been posted yet, try to include a minimal `reprex` that shows the issue, if possible. If you've never heard of a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/) before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>. At the very least, be as specific as possible so we can best help you with your question!
